While the yolk hosts strong nutritional value, to lower unnecessary fat content, Bailey suggests limiting yolks, depending on how many eggs you normally consume.I make the conscious choice to only use one egg yolk in order to eliminate unnecessary fat intake from eating eight egg yolks, he says.Opting for organic, free-range eggs is also a way to up your egg health. Supporting local farmers is a great way to boost your morning nutrients while supporting your community. When cooking the eggs, try using cooking spray instead of butter, to once again avoid excess fats.</p>"

Bailey recommends eating traditional, unflavored oats topped with a small amount of brown sugar and a very light drizzle of maple syrup. This way you're giving your tastebuds a treat without overdoing the sugar content.A bowl of plain oats is a blank slate and there are many clean toppings at your service. Berries, nuts, nut butter, and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg make for a flavorful bowl. “Oats are a complex carb that will keep you full longer and your body absorbs more nutrients from complex carbohydrates, Bailey says. So, build your bowl with your favorite toppings and you're good to go!</p>"
